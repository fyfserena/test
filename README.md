Abstract: Our country, China is a major pork consumer, so that stabilizing the pork price is a practical problem in China. In this paper, we explore the mechanism of pork price fluctuations as well as propose an effective pork price forecasting model. First of all, the variables that affect the price of pork theoretically, such as the supply for pork, the demand for pork, the price of substitutes, and the network public opinion related to the price of pork, are explored by using common data mining techniques such as correlation analysis, association analysis, regression analysis. The time series VAR model is established based on the selected significant variables. Based on this VAR model, the average price of pork in China is predicted, and it is concluded that the pork price will continue to rise in the first half of 2020. Secondly, considering that the fluctuation of pork prices in each province is different, a dynamic panel data model is established. The main conclusions are as follows: The factors that significantly affect the pork price are the supply for pork and the network public opinion, while the demand for pork, the price of substitutes, and the cost price have no significant effect on the pork price. The seasonal factors which can influence the fluctuation of pork price are not obvious in the background of this swine fever.

Still need some time to organize the coding part.
